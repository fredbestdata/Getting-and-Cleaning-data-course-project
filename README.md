# Getting and Cleaning data course project
This is the Peer-graded assignment from the Getting and Cleaning Data Course

In this assignment a tidy data set is made that can be used for later analysis. The assignment is graded by fellow students. 
The following items are included in this repository:
- A tidy data set
- A CodeBook.md that describes the data and the variables and the transformations that are done to clean up the data
- A run_analysis.R script which is the script that has been used to clean up the data in R
- This README.md file explains how the scripts work and how the scripts are connected.

# How do the scripts work and how are they connected?
